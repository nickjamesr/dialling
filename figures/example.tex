  \caption{A \(4 \by 4\) unitary, expressed in linear optics according to the
    scheme in \cite{re-prl-73-58}, and the appropriate \pdf s for choosing
    parameters for a Haar unitary. The reflectivities of the bottom three
    beamsplitters (region (a), shaded green) can be chosen uniformly from the
    interval \(\left[ 0,1 \right)\); those on the second row (region (b),
    shaded red) are chosen from a linear distribution biased towards lower
    reflectivities; and the top one is chosen from a quadratic distribution,
    even more biased towards lower reflectivities.}
