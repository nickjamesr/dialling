# Direct Dialling
How do we choose parameters in a Reck scheme in order to generate Haar random
unitaries? This paper answers that question, with a proof of the validity. We
consider the case of a general m x m unitary, and then go on to apply it to an
n-qubit unitary via a (non-polynomial) reduction.
